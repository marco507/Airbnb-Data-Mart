Was a great stay considering the price. Fast responding host, all necessary features were included in the apparent. At first there wasn’t a blow dried found, however the friendly host had fixed the issue in an hour and provided the blow drier.;3.3;1
The host was super friendly, always replying fast and gave me all the information needed. Definitely recommandable!;5.0;2
Okay for a few nights. Host is very polite. Only thing I'm not happy with is that the room was not cleaned upon arrival, but the host sorted it out very quickly.;2.7;3
Centrally situated and price-worthy place. Ideal for short term stays but also convenient for longer stays;4.0;4

Good place for a short stay. Great location!;4.3;9
First (& hopefully only!) bad experience with AirBnB lodging & host. Steep stairs should come with a warning, the room should come with a measurement per m2 (so tiny). Very pricey for what it is. The best thing I can say is that the location of the AirBnB is great. Worst thing I can say: hands down the worst host I had to deal with. I also felt watched. Felt like I had 0 privacy. I had to leave the night of & preferred to stay at the airport. Wouldn’t recommend it to a single woman travelling alone. Just my opinion.;1.0;10
Great place to stop over - no frills but what you need.;3.8;11
Good value for money in a great location;4.1;12
Good place to stay one night before the flight but expect that it could be chilly at the winter;3.5;13
Perfect location. Spacious accommodations. Clean. Clear communication.;4.3;14
This apartment is perfect for a stay in Mexico City. The location ca not be beat- short and beautiful walks away from tons of the best bars, restaurants and shops. The apartment itself was excellent too. Comfortable bed, plenty of room, fast wifi if you need to work, and a quiet building overall. Karina was an excellent host and responded to me within minutes. Will definitely be coming back!;5.0;15
Quiet and stylish place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Mexico City. Highly recommend staying here if you have the chance!;4.3;16
The places was okay. It was not the best, unfortunately. But, since I did npt see other comments with the same experience I had. I wonder if it was just a mistake and the cleaning person mess up. The beds and towels smell bad. Like someone just had checked out the same day and they did not have time to change or air out. The doors of my apartment open by themselves on my 3rd day and that was scary because at that time I was sleeping alone and did not feel safe. There was an earthquake the 2nd day I stay there and the front door did not want to open. Fortunately there was a guy who was staying there and managed to open it before the earthquake happened. The neighborhood is nice and close to a lot of good restaurants and supper;2.3;17
Very nice place in a central location!;3.9;18
Clean convenient, close to many subway stations including Tokyo station. Everything you need, and quiet as there was only one other guest at the time we were there.;4.1;19
Very decent accommodations. It is a multiple story building but there is an elevator. There is also a washing machine and a dryer on the roof. Staff are very friendly. Can speak English, Japanese and Chinese. Location 1 train station away from Akihabara and near multiple train stations. Very convenient. Some food stores and convenience stores around nearby as well.;3.2;20
Place is kept quite clean. There was a microwave, an electric teapot, and a refrigerator in the common area. There was ample space in the room that I had and the hosts were very kind.;4.6;21
A bit of a walk from the station but very comfy place to stay.;3.2;22
Easy self check in and check out. The location is perfect for a young couple. He responded quickly and the place was very pleasant.;4.7;23
A cute apartment in a brilliant location in the heart of Rome, perfectly located for all central sights and attractions.;4.2;24
Great location in a prime spot of Trastevere. Self check-in was very easy. Highly recommend this apartment if you want to be in the heart of the night life.;5.0;25
A perfect AirBnB in the heart of Trastevere.;4.8;26
The best view of Rio right at your window. If your are an early bird there is no other place you would rather be for the sunrise. Botafogo is also a nice neighborhood, with several bars and restaurants, you will certainly find a good place to decompress after a tough day.;4.5;27
Absolutely amazing view, nice area, host is very helpful, quick responses. Loved our stay!;4.0;28
Perfect!!!;5.0;29
Great hosts and very nice apartment!;4.1;30
The apartment is in a great location and many sights are within walking distance. There are a couple bars, a currency exchange place and a shopping center nearby. Check-in and check-out were also very easy.;4.8;31
Wifi was bad and it would be better if toilet is not shared toilet. Location is perfect, hosts are so nice and it was easy to communicate :);3.6;32
Nice place to stay. Location is amazing and definitely worth to accommodate.;4.3;33
It is a well place appartement ! Great to be located in the center of the City near the famous monuments ! Thanks !;3.8;34
Everything was fine, except that the room I stayed in was not the one shown in the picture;2.9;35
Excellent place to stay in the city. Very private and very clean :);4.3;36
Apartment is very quiet and comfortable, with everything one needs, the location is great. Excellent value for money, highly recommended!;4.5;37
Great host and a really cozy place to stay. I will come back again!;4.7;38
This was a horrible experience. The place was not as shown. The host messaged me roughly 30 minute before check in and said the current place is not available. It was windy and cold and I had just gotten off my can. I will never forget this experience. While standing out in the wind I tried calling the host who was not available and some other man spoke on his behalf. This too after several attempts of reaching answering machine (again, let me remind you it was in cold windy roadside). ;1.0;39
Would only rent if it is on sale;;40
